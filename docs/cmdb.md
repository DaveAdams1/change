# Configuration Management System (CMS)

## Is CMDB still relevant in these Cloud / Hybrid days?

The simple answer is yes, because...


Although a lot has changed over the last ten years, with the  rapid uptake of compute, database, storage and applications being provisioned in the cloud through highly automated frameworks, and the fact these resources can be stood up and stood down faster than you can raise a change request, you may be forgiven for ask why.

- A significant number of enterprise CMDB's are a running joke, comprised of not one source of truth, but many "definitive and accurate", yet siloed and fiercely guarded by department heads playing internal politics.
- More and more IT budget and resources get wasted on yet another discovery tool which kills the network and gives conflicting results with the last 3!
  
- ITIL and Agile / DevOps don't mix, in fact the contradict each other
